==Bach Phan - wanderking's blog

== Welcome
 I am a mechanical enginneering senior at University of Washington Bothell as of 2019. My intention for this website is to document my progress and research on a Finite Element Analysis Sandbox program I am working on. I also want to write about interesting implementations and quirky details in OpenGL.
